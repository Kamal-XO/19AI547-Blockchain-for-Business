# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol
## DATE : 21.04.2025
## Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

## Algorithm:
### step 1:
Deploy contract and set the owner, interest rate, and liquidation threshold.

### step 2:
User deposits funds by calling deposit() and sending Ether to the contract.

### step 3:
Check collateral and ensure it meets the required threshold for borrowing.

### step 4:
User borrows funds by calling borrow(amount), transferring borrowed funds to the user.

### step 5:
Record deposits in the deposits mapping and borrowed amounts in the borrowed mapping.

### step 6:
Accumulate interest (future step, not implemented in current contract).

### step 7:
Check liquidation if the userâ€™s collateral is below 150% of the borrowed amount.

### step 8:
Liquidate borrower by calling liquidate() and transferring seized collateral to the caller.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches key DeFi concepts: lending, borrowing, collateral, liquidation.


Introduces risk management: overcollateralization and liquidation.


Directly related to DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.

# RESULT : 
Thus the DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol is successfully implemented.
