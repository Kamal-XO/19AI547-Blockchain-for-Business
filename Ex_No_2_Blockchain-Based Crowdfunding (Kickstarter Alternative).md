# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
## DATE : 16.04.2025
## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
Deploy a smart contract where the project owner sets the funding goal and deadline.

### Step 2:
Define campaign details: project owner address, funding goal, deadline, total contributions, and contributors.

### Step 3:
Contributors send ETH to the campaign, and their contribution is recorded in the contract.

### Step 4:
The smart contract tracks the total ETH raised for the campaign.

### Step 5:
After each contribution, check if the funding goal is met before the deadline.

### Step 6:
If the goal is met before the deadline, release funds to the project owner. If the goal isn’t met before the deadline, allow contributors to withdraw their funds.

### Step 7:
Contributors can withdraw their funds if the goal was not met.

### Step 8:
Once the deadline passes, the campaign ends, and either funds are released to the owner or refunded to contributors.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches decentralized fundraising.


Avoids fraud by ensuring funds are only transferred if the goal is met.

# RESULT: 
Thus the Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding is successfully implemented.
